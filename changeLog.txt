Version 0.4: January 29, 2015

- OTI::SpecificationRoot::packageURI
- OTI::ID
- OTI::ID::uuid
- Cannonical XMI DocmentSet writer

Version 0.3: January 29, 2015

- Added UMLModel
- forwardReferencesFromMetamodelAssociations

Align the criteria used to the OMG MOF/XMI spec, that is
directed, non-composite, non-derived properties

- simplified the canonicalXMI.Document/DocumentSet model

Simplification allows decoupling the modeling of Documents from 
the analysis of element-level and document-level cross-references

Version 0.2: January 29, 2015

Add support for calculating the forward references from an Element.

This is needed to serialize OTI models into OMG Canonical XMI documents since the serialization of a local element reference
is different from that of an external element reference (see "Linking" in the OMG MOF/XMI spec)

Version 0.1: January 28, 2015

Added SBT configuration.
Added org.omg.oti.canonicalXMI based on TIWG teleconference call discussions to avoid having to write tool-specific => tool-infrastructure save converters (XSL, ...)
