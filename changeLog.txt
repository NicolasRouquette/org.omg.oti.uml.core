Version 0.5.1: January 31, 2015

- Naming convention subtleties

Element.mofMetaclass
Extension.metaclass

Profile.profileApplications_appliedProfile
Package.appliedProfile

Property.association_navigableOwnedEnd
Property.association_memberEnd

Version 0.5.0: January 31, 2015

- naming convention for names of association member end properties:

-- singular if multiplicity is 0..1 or 1; plural otherwise
-- for the name of an opposite association member end property (regardless of navigability):
--- use the (opposite association member end) property name (if unambiguous)
--- use the property name suffixed with "_<opposite member end property type name>" (if unambiguous)
--- use the property name suffixed with "_<opposite member end property name>" (if unambiguous)
--- use the property name suffixed with "_<opposite member end property type name>_<opposite member end property name>" (if unambiguous)

- add support for serializing non-derived composite & reference properties
-- UMLElement.{composite,reference}MetaProperties
-- every metaclass defines: <metaclass name>_{composite,reference}MetaProperties to include the superclasses' meta-properties before the metaclass' properties
   (see OMG Canonical XMI ordering rules)
-- every concrete metaclass defines:

override def {composite,reference}MetaProperties: MetaPropertyFunctions = <metaclass name>_{composite,reference}MetaProperties

- added several data attributes

Version 0.4: January 29, 2015

- OTI::SpecificationRoot::packageURI
- OTI::ID
- OTI::ID::uuid
- Cannonical XMI DocmentSet writer

Version 0.3: January 29, 2015

- Added UMLModel
- forwardReferencesFromMetamodelAssociations

Align the criteria used to the OMG MOF/XMI spec, that is
directed, non-composite, non-derived properties

- simplified the canonicalXMI.Document/DocumentSet model

Simplification allows decoupling the modeling of Documents from 
the analysis of element-level and document-level cross-references

Version 0.2: January 29, 2015

Add support for calculating the forward references from an Element.

This is needed to serialize OTI models into OMG Canonical XMI documents since the serialization of a local element reference
is different from that of an external element reference (see "Linking" in the OMG MOF/XMI spec)

Version 0.1: January 28, 2015

Added SBT configuration.
Added org.omg.oti.canonicalXMI based on TIWG teleconference call discussions to avoid having to write tool-specific => tool-infrastructure save converters (XSL, ...)
